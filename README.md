# Prediction of Customer who will Subscribe to a Term Deposit: To minimize cost of direct marketing campaign


A Portuguese banking institution has, in the past, conducted a direct marketing campaign, by phone calls, to increase the number of customers subscribing to a term deposit. The bank should conduct another campaign for the same financial product. However, It costs to conduct such a direct marketing campaign. The bank can minimize the cost of the next campaign if it can predict the customers that will subscribe to the term deposit if they are targeted by the marketing campaign. Fortunately, the bank can use its own data to learn from its previous experience regarding the direct marketing campaign about the term deposit

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that allow the bank to predict if a customer will subscribe to the term deposit, at a recall rate of 95% at least. This project is essential to help the bank to minimize the cost of the direct marketing campaign. Minimizing its costs is important for a bank, since it should maximize its profits.
