# Prediction of Customer who will Subscribe to a Term Deposit: To minimize cost of direct marketing campaign

## 1) Preambule
A Portuguese banking institution has, in the past, conducted a direct marketing campaign, by phone calls, to increase the number of customers subscribing to a term deposit. The bank should conduct another campaign for the same financial product. However, It costs to conduct such a direct marketing campaign. Indeed, contactacting customers who will not subscribe to the term deposit is wasting money. Since the goal of the bank is to maximize profit, it cannot afford to loose money. Then, it is essential that the bank predicts the customers who will subscribe to the term deposit.

This project intends to predict the customers who will buy the term deposit. It should help the bank to minimize the cost of the direct marketing campaign. Minimizing its costs is important for a bank, since it should maximize its profits. To reach this goal


## 2) Methodology

To reach the goal of this project, a machine learning model is used, using data from a previous experience of the of the bank. To evaluate the model to predict the customers who will subscribe to the term deposit, the recall rate is used. We expect to reach a recall rate of 95% at least.
*(The methodology will be explained deeper sooner.)*

## 3) Results
The recall rate of the current version is 89%. I am working on the project to improve the recall rate, since my goal is to reach 95% at least.
